Machine Learning Simple Chatbot

What is a Chatbot?
A Chatbot, also called an Artificial chat agent, is a software program driven by machine learning algorithms that aim at simulating a human-human like conversation with a user by either taking input as text or speech from the user.

Where is it used?
Chatbots have extensive usage, and we can not expound on all the possibilities where it can be of use. But basically, you'll find them in: Help desks, transaction processing, customer support, booking services, and providing 24-7 real-time chat with clients.

At the current technology stand, most companies are slowly transitioning to use chatbots for their in-demand day-day services. A good example that everybody uses is the Google Assistant, Apple Siri, Samsung Bixby, and Amazon Alexa.

In this article, we will learn how to create one in Python using TensorFlow to train the model and Natural Language Processing(nltk) to help the machine understand user queries.


There are two broad categories of chatbots:

Rule-Based approach - Here the bot is trained based on some set rules. It is from these rules that the bot can process simple queries but can fail to process complex ones.

Self-Learning approach - Here the bot uses some machine learning algorithms and techniques to chat. It is further subcategorized into two:

Retrieval-Based models - In this model, the bot retrieves the best response from a list depending on the user input.
Generative models - This model comes up with an answer rather than searching from a given list. These are the Intelligent Bots.

In this chatbot, we will use the rule-based approach.


As further improvements you can try different tasks to enhance performance and features.
Use more data to train: 
You can add more data to the training dataset. A large dataset with a good number of intents can lead to making a powerful chatbot solution.

Apply different NLP techniques: You can add more NLP solutions to your chatbot solution like NER (Named Entity Recognition) in order to add more features to your chatbot. With having a NER model along with your chatbot, you can easily find out any entity that appeared in user chat messages and use it for further conversations. 

And also you can add a Sentiment Analysis model to identify different sentiment tones behind user messages and it will exactly give some additional colors to your chatbot.

Try different neural network architectures: You can also try different neural network architectures with different hyperparameters.
